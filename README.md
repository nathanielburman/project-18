# project-18
Project 18 and sexual reproduction with statehood bias and permitting sexual health systems.

1. 18 is an arbitrary number for adulthood

2. adulthood begins somewhere at puberty

3, adulthood endes somewhere around 24-27 yesrs scientifically

4. therefore, a range of ages works better ie (13 - 24)

5. states should create a protected class for the 13 - 24 age range

6. permits should be granted in the earliest dating pool, 13 a 24

7. green permits granted for consensual relationships

8. blue permits granted above 24

9. greens cannot sleep with blues unless it is tracked by the permiting system

this project aims at solving the sexual crisis in the world where we currently label 18 young adults as pedophiles at 18 yrs old and younger.
